This is the repository is part of the [Laser4DIY project](http://www.laser4diy.org/).

## Description 

This repository contains the CAD files for the machined metal parts needed to build the LASER4DIY laser source.

Please note that this documentation is distributed without any express or implied warranty. Use it at your own risk. Please also read the details of the CERN-OHL license.

## Configuration

The parts can be arranged for two setups: the microchip configuation used in LASER4DIY, and the amplifier configuration, with is an optional addon for LASER4DIY. The following parts are stacked for the two configurations (from bottom to top):

Config Microchip (MC):
* 1x baseplate (Al)
* 1x plexi spacer (PMMA)
* 1x cooler (Al)
* 1x Peltier element
* 1x MC-heatspreader (Cu)
* 1x MC-bracket-A (Cu)
* 1x MC-bracket-B (Cu)
* 1x MC-lensbar (Al)  

Config Amplifier (AMP):
* 1x baseplate (Al)
* 1x plexi spacer (PMMA)
* 1x cooler (Al)
* 1x Peltier element
* 1x AMP-heatspreader (Cu)
* 1x AMP-bracket-A (Cu)
* 1x AMP-bracket-B (Cu)

This is what the amplifier configuration looks like:
